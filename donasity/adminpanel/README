   INTRODUCTION
===================

RainFramework is an MVC framework for PHP, it has a strong but easy structure,
it divides logic by presentation, with the following MVC organization:

               
                                 MODELS
                                    ^
user                                |
input    >     LOADER  ---->   CONTROLLERS ----> VIEWS

             

- LOADER, is the heart of the framework:
	* get the input
	* include libraries
	* init settings
	* connect database
	* authenticate the user
	* load the controller, selected by the user with the URI (es index.php/news/list/)
	* draw the output

- CONTROLLERS, are the components that do "stuff", they load Models to retrieve data and draw the output with views

- MODELS, get the information from database

- VIEWS, are HTML templates, loaded with RainTPL
